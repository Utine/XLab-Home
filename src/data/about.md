# Intro
Dr. Jinjun Xiong is an Empire Innovation Professor with the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University at Buffalo (UB) . He received his Ph.D. degree in 2006 from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with an Outstanding Ph.D. Award, his M.S. degree from University of Wisconsin, Madison in 2002, and his M.S. and B.S. degrees from Tsinghua University in 2000 and 1998, respectively.

Before joining UB in 2021, Dr. Xiong was Program Director and Senior Research Scientist at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY.  He co-founded and co-directed the IBM-Illinois Center for Cognitive Computing Systems Research with Prof. Wen-mei Hwu. Under their leadership, the C3SR center has expanded from the early days' eight faculty members in 2016 to close to 40 faculty members in 2021. The success of the C3SR center also led to the creation of the new IBM-Illinois Discovery Accelerator Institute, a joint $200-million research investment between IBM and UIUC. Dr. Xiong also co-founded the IBM Smarter Energy Research Institute and led a number of enterprise-scale collaborations with world-wide electric utility companies to address sustainability issues with renewable integration. 

# Research Interests

- Building novel applied AI solutions and systems involving emerging technologies (such as IoT, AR/VR, edge clouds, and quantum computers) to address critical issues that matter the most to our society and humanities.

- Conducting fundamental data-driven science research through data collected from deployed AI systems, such as an AI-augmented learning platform to answer questions on human-AI collaboration, self-directed learning, intelligent knowledge discovery, and racial and social equity issues.

- Co-optimizeing AI systems at the intersection of multiple levels, including the computing level with modern and emerging computing devices and paradigms, the algorithmic level with data, AI, machine learning and deep learning, and the application level centering around human and society.
